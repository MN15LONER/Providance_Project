## 🔥 Issue 1: Firebase Storage Permissions

### Problem:

### 🔒 Security Rules Created:
```javascript
// Profile Pictures - Users can only upload their own
match /profile_pictures/{userId}.jpg {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Issue Images - Users can only upload their own
match /issue_images/{userId}/{imageId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Idea Images - Users can only upload their own
match /idea_images/{userId}/{imageId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```
