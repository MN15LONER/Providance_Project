## üîß Firebase Storage Rules

To enable profile picture uploads, ensure your Firebase Storage rules allow authenticated users to upload to the `profile_pictures` folder:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_pictures/{userId}.jpg {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üìù Notes

- Profile pictures are stored in Firebase Storage at `profile_pictures/{userId}.jpg`
- Images are automatically compressed to 512x512 pixels at 75% quality
- Password reset uses Firebase Auth's built-in functionality
- All navigation uses GoRouter for type-safe routing
- User statistics are fetched on-demand and cached by Riverpod
- Profile data updates are reflected immediately across the app

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Firebase Storage**: Only authenticated users can upload their own profile pictures
2. **Firestore**: User can only update their own profile data (enforced by security rules)
3. **Password Reset**: Uses Firebase Auth's secure password reset flow
4. **Image Upload**: Images are compressed before upload to prevent large file attacks
